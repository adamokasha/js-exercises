### 6 - Higher order functions

For this exercises, please use the following ES6 higher order functions (a function that takes a function as an argument or returns one):
```
map
filter
forEach
```

and write these function:
1. A function that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the integers squared using map
2. A function that takes an array of integers and filters out all the odd numbers using filter
3. A function that takes an array of strings and uppercases all the strings using forEach (modifying it in place)
4. To test solutions run `yarn test`
